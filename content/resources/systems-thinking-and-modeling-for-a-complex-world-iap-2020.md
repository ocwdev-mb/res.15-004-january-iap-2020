**Description:** Full session video recording of _Systems Thinking and Dyamic Modeling for a Complex Wold_ which was taught in January 2020 during MIT's Independent Activities Period (IAP). This one-day workshop provides a brief overview of System Dynamics and a hands-on simulation experience, the Fishbanks Management Simulation. It also serves as a preview of the more in-depth coverage of system dynamics available in courses offered at MIT Sloan such as 15.871, 15.872, and 15.873. _\[Note: The Fishbanks Management Simulation is removed due to copyright restrictions_._\]_

**Speaker:** James Edward Paine
